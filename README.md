This is a personal project of mine that I intend to continuously develope.It's a clone of the netflix website. My biggest issue when making this was finding the perfect movie API that would display the top 10 movies like it is on the netflix website. I did find one but I ended up maxing out the number of requests I can make per month. I probably should've cached itðŸ˜¥...Won't make the same mistake next time. I also don't know how netflix makes their floating get started button like that so I just placed It in the bottom Like that. I couldn't find the image netflix used for their hero section so i had to improvise. Also I added all my images to an assets file in the app, I won't do that going forward because it's horrible practice

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## CONTINOUS DEVELOPMENT
I intend to add a sign up and a log in page and then a home page where users can view tons of movies exactly like netflix (without the movie player), I'll make it the link to the trailer. This file will be updated going forward.
